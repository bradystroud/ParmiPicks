This was a very good Parmi. Good amount of salad. The chips had this great herby salt and a good crunch. 

Parmi had a lovely crunch, good size and nice amount of cheese.

Controversially they did not add and ham or bacon, and missing sauce. 

With a few improvements this could have been a great parmi.

I know this one was missing a few things but they did everything else superbly



Editors note: 

> Another review from Amy - thanks Amy 🙂.\
> I was surprised at the positivity of this review due to the parmi missing some really key components.\
> To understand the significance of this, we need a quick history lesson. Where did the name *parmi *come from?\

> **Chicken** - chicken is chicken\
> **parmigiana** - an Italian word meaning in the style of [Parma](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari\&rls=en\&q=Parma), referring to dishes baked with **tomato sauce** and cheese, traditionally eggplant (melanzane alla parmigiana).\
> So a chicken parmigiana is just that idea swapped with chicken — crumbed, fried, topped with **tomato sauce**, melted cheese, and typically ham.\
