# Parmi Side Dishes: Beyond Basic Chips and Salad

While the classic combo of chips and garden salad has become the standard accompaniment to a chicken parmi, innovative venues are pushing the boundaries with creative side dishes. Let's explore some exciting alternatives that can elevate your parmi experience.

## The Classic Evolution

### Chips Reimagined:
- Sweet potato fries
- Beer-battered steak fries
- Seasoned wedges
- Curly fries
- Triple-cooked chips

### Salad Upgrades:
- Greek salad with feta
- Rocket and parmesan
- Coleslaw
- Asian-inspired slaw
- Quinoa and roasted vegetable salad

## Modern Alternatives

### Vegetable Sides:
- Grilled broccolini
- Roasted Mediterranean vegetables
- Saut√©ed mushrooms
- Steamed seasonal greens
- Honey-glazed carrots

### Gourmet Options:
- Truffle mash
- Potato gratin
- Roasted root vegetables
- Cauliflower cheese
- Grilled corn on the cob

## The Importance of Side Placement

A often overlooked aspect of parmi sides is their placement on the plate:
- Chips should never be under the parmi (prevents soggy bottom)
- Salad should be separate to maintain crispness
- Hot sides should be positioned to stay warm
- Consider sauce flow when plating

## Creative Combinations

Some standout combinations I've encountered:
- Sweet potato fries with aioli
- Steamed greens with garlic butter
- Roasted vegetables with balsamic glaze
- Asian slaw with sesame dressing
- Loaded mash with bacon bits

## The Perfect Balance

When choosing sides, consider:
- Temperature contrast
- Texture variety
- Complementary flavors
- Portion size
- Nutritional balance

While there's nothing wrong with the classic chips and salad combo, exploring different side options can transform a good parmi into an exceptional dining experience. The key is ensuring the sides complement rather than compete with the main event - our beloved chicken parmi.
