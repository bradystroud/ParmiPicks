Impressive stuff... Parmi didn't look that appealing at first glance, so I lowered my expectations. I checked the bottom of the chicken schnitzel and there were no soggy bits! It was also a real chicken breast which was awesome. Toppings tasted better than they look, the cheese could have used a little extra crisp though. The structural integrity of this palm was impressive as well, there was enough cheese melted to hold the whole thing together.

The sides were a mixed bag. The chips were bussin' but salad had lots of big cherry tomatoes, bit overpowering.\

First time I've seen a parmi with a drink paring recommendation - Stone and Wood's Pacific Ale.
