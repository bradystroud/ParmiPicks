First international parmi! The Rossi Restaurant in Port Vila, Vanuatu.

Chefs were definitely under pressure with this one - we ordered right before a 'bigfala storm' started.

Starting from the top, cheese cover was cool, could've used a little more care on the edges though.
Sauce was ok but not enough. The ham was just a slab from a packet, no dice or slice.
The piece of chicken was small and slightly overcooked.

Chips were slightly soggy but ok.
Salad not worth mentioning

Presentation - I found the parmi was strategically place on top of the chips, which gave it a bit of a powerful ambience. Perched up there like the king of the plate, CTBM.

Sorry about the poor image quality, I kept it because it fit the vibe of this meal - unfocused.
