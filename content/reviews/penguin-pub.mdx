GREAT Parmi! Who knew Tasmania could pull off such a feat.

$32 - Price was a bit of a stretch, but maybe thats normal for this funny little island.

The chicken was huge, bigger than my hand. cheese was cheesy, but there was not enough.

The ham was those little long ham noodley things - very good ü§åüèº

Chips, not enough

Salad was swimming in vinegar, lots of tang.

Mushroom gravy was very rich. World richest mushroom gravy. There was oodles as well - enough of all the parmi and chips.
