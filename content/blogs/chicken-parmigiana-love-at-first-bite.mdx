## The Origins of Chicken Parmigiana

The roots of chicken parmigiana trace back to the classic Italian dish, melanzane alla parmigiana, which features layers of eggplant (as well as cheese and marinara sauce). The adaptation using chicken emerged as immigrants brought their culinary traditions to the United States and Australia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This vibrant dish adapted, transformed, and emerged into the chicken parmigiana we know today, showcasing a spirit of innovation within the culinary world and a perfect match for a hearty appetite!

## A Tale of Transformations

Every chef brings their own flair to chicken parmigiana, resulting in an array of adaptations that reflect regional tastes and preferences. In the United States, you might find it served in a classic Italian-American style: a breaded and fried chicken breast, topped with marinara sauce and oozing cheese, often served with spaghetti on the side. Meanwhile, the Australian twist sometimes sees the dish served as a pub meal, generously sized and often paired with chips and salad. The versatility of chicken parmigiana allows it to adapt to various local cuisines while maintaining its soul - a comforting, cheesy experience that warms the heart.
