Feeling poetic today

At Seacliff's view, the parmi shines,
A hearty dish with bold designs.
Golden chicken, crisp and prime,
But more cheese would make it sublime.

The mushy sauce, a creamy delight,
Paired with fries, both crispy and light.
The salad's fresh, a garden's pride,
A perfect balance served on the side.

Stringy ham, a daring choice,
A step from diced but finds its voice.
A plate so big, it breaks the seams ,
Yet lacks the cheese to crown its dreams.

By the shore, this meal takes stage,
A seaside feast to please and engage. ðŸŒŠ
