Bangin - strait bangin

Another heart shaped chicken piece. Crispy bacon on top, normally I'm a fan of diced, but this was cool.

Salad was poor - grow up, get me some greens. ðŸŒ±

Chips good but not many. Sauce - good.

$34 - Brisbane had an average price of $28, down south they seem to all be $30+

Inflation? ðŸ¤”
