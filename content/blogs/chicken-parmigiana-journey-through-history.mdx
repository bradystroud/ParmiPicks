Join us as we embark on a journey through the origins, evolution, and ever-growing popularity of chicken parmigiana.

## The Roots of Chicken Parmigiana

While loved by many today, the exact origins of chicken parmigiana are somewhat murky. Historians often trace its ancestry back to the classic Italian dish, Melanzane alla Parmigiana, which features thinly sliced eggplant layered with cheese and tomatoes. The practice of breading and frying protein can be found in many culinary traditions, leading to the belief that chicken due to a cultural mash-up, became an important adaptation in Italian-American kitchens.

In the bustling neighborhoods of early 20th-century New York City, Italian immigrants took to their kitchens and began crafting dishes that resonated with their heritage while incorporating American ingredients. As a result, chicken was introduced into the beloved Parmigiana family, and the dish we know today began to take shape.

Moreover, the preparation methods have changed over time, with many opting for the convenience of oven-baked or even air-fried variations, allowing everyone to enjoy the flavors without the guilt of frying.
