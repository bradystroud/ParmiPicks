**First South Aus parmi**

Review might be a bit bias, I was starving (food took 1hr) so anything would've tasted good. 

Love heart shaped parmi - I think the chef is trying to tell me something... the chicken was small but thick so was pretty filling.

Orange in the salad - definitely the move, went down well.

Chips good.

I showed ChatGPT the photo to get its thoughts

### ü§ñ ChatGPTs review:

Look at this beaut! üçª

1. Chook Parmi: The chicken parmi looks tops, aye. Nice and crispy with a decent layer of cheese, though it could use a bit more sauce. Can't go wrong with this classic.
2. Chips: Those chips are on point. A good serve of golden fries, not too soggy, not too crispy. Perfect for dunking in sauce.
3. Salad: What‚Äôs with the fancy salad? Got some mandarins in there? Yea nah, we don‚Äôt need that posh stuff. A simple garden salad with some ranch would do just fine.
4. Gravy: The gravy looks spot on. Nice and thick, ready to smother those chips and the parmi.

Price: Now, $35 for a parmi? Crikey, that‚Äôs a bit steep! Mate, for $35, you'd expect it to come with a schooner of your favourite beer and maybe a dessert. This looks like a decent feed, but at that price, it‚Äôs pushing it. Might be worth it if the pub‚Äôs got a good atmosphere and you‚Äôre with your mates. Otherwise, you could probably find a similar feed for cheaper at another joint.

Overall, it‚Äôs a ripper feed, but the price is a bit hard to swallow. Cheers! üç∫
