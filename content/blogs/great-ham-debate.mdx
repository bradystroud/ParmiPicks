# The Great Debate: Ham vs. No Ham on Your Chicken Parmi

In the world of chicken parmigiana, few topics spark as much debate as the inclusion of ham. This seemingly simple addition has divided parmi enthusiasts for years, so let's dive into both sides of this meaty argument.

## The Pro-Ham Camp

### Arguments for Ham:
- Adds an extra layer of savory flavor
- Provides a nice salty contrast
- Traditional in many Australian pubs
- Creates additional texture complexity
- Helps protect the crumb from getting soggy

## The Ham-Free Purists

### Arguments Against Ham:
- Detracts from the pure chicken experience
- Can make the dish too salty
- Often uses low-quality processed ham
- Adds unnecessary calories
- Not part of the original Italian recipe

## The Middle Ground

Some venues have found creative compromises:
- Using premium prosciutto instead of regular ham
- Offering ham as an optional add-on
- Substituting with bacon (a growing trend)
- Incorporating ham into the sauce instead

## What the Reviews Say

From my experience reviewing parmis across various venues, the execution matters more than the presence of ham itself. A folded piece of cheap ham can ruin an otherwise excellent parmi, while a thoughtfully added slice of quality ham can elevate the dish.

## The Verdict

There's no definitive right answer - it comes down to personal preference. However, if a venue chooses to include ham, it should:
- Use quality ham
- Apply it thoughtfully
- Ensure it complements rather than overwhelms
- Consider offering a ham-free option

Whether you're Team Ham or Team No-Ham, we can all agree that the quality of the chicken, crumbing, sauce, and cheese are the most crucial elements of a great parmi.
