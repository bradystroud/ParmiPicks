Presentation was good. Though the mushroom sauce was in a little paper cup.

Very good sauce though. Salad good. Not a fan of the grated beetroot - no flavour.

Chicken was beautiful - nice crumb, great cheese and good bit of ham. Not as good as bacon bits though ðŸ˜Š

> Was very excited to see Amy getting her hands dirty with a Parmi review - her original rating was a bit optimistic (8.8) but the notes and feedback were spot on. I'm looking forward to seeing more reviews from Amy in the future. ðŸ™‚
