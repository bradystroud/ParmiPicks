## Why Photograph a Parmi at All?
A great chicken parmigiana is a mini drama of textures: shattering crumb, molten cheese, glossy sauce, and those chips standing guard. Capturing that personality on camera isn’t just for influencers—it’s a way to share a moment, remember a standout pub night, and do justice to a dish that deserves a spotlight. Here’s how to photograph a parmi so it looks as irresistible as it tastes—without studio gear or food-stylist tricks.

## Light: The Crunch Maker
- Sit near a window for soft side light that sculpts crumb texture. Overhead lighting flattens everything; if that’s all you have, shift the plate closer to the edge of the table and angle the phone slightly to side-light the surface.
- Diffuse harsh light with a napkin or menu held between window and plate. It calms shiny sauce hotspots and reveals more detail in the cheese.
- Kill mixed light. If you’re by a window, switch off your phone’s flash and avoid sitting under heat lamps if possible. Mixed color temperatures cause weird orange or green casts that are tough to fix.

## Angles That Flatter the Parmi
- 45 degrees: The hero angle. Shows height, crumb texture, chip pile, and a generous sweep of sauce.
- Straight-on: Perfect for a tight crop of the cheese, ham, and sauce layers. Ideal for a dramatic cheese pull (more on that next).
- Overhead: Great for plate styling and chip geometry, but use sparingly—the schnitty can look flattened from above. If you go top-down, elevate visual interest with diagonally placed cutlery and a folded napkin.

## The Cheese Pull, Deconstructed
- Pre-cut a clean wedge before you shoot, so the pull has an anchor. Let the cheese rest 20–30 seconds after serving to get that elastic stretch without a lava spill.
- Two-fork technique: One fork lifts, the other stabilizes the body of the parmi. Ask a mate to hold the lift while you shoot burst mode.
- Frame tight and shoot slightly backlit so the cheese filaments glow. Keep shutter quick by tapping to focus on the pull and sliding exposure a notch brighter.

## Taming Shine and Sauce
- Blot lightly with a corner of napkin to remove excess oil puddles without disturbing the crumb.
- If the sauce looks flat, spoon a micro “ripple” along the edge to catch light. Shiny, not greasy, is the goal.
- Watch reds. Tomato sauce can clip and look neon. Underexpose a touch and lift shadows later when editing.

## Plateware and Props (Use What’s on the Table)
- Matte beats glossy. If you can choose, go for matte plates or wooden boards that keep glare at bay and make the crumb stand out.
- Add context with neutral props: the water glass, a beer coaster, a folded napkin. Keep patterns minimal—your parmi is the star.
- Warm tones complement the dish. A wooden table or parchment paper under the parmi reads hearty and welcoming.

## Steam and Heat, Without the Haze
- Shoot while it’s hot for natural gloss and gentle steam. If your lens fogs, step back, wipe the lens with a clean cloth, and give the plate 10 seconds to settle.
- For subtle steam in-frame, place a hot chip just behind the cut line; it can produce a delicate wispy effect without fogging the lens.

## Composition That Tells a Story
- Lead the eye from chips to parmi to sauce using diagonals—angle your cutlery and napkin to point toward the main subject.
- Embrace negative space on the plate to avoid clutter. A clean corner makes the crumb pop.
- Include a bite scene: a forkful hovering over the plate or a chip dipping into runaway sauce adds movement and appetite appeal.

## Make It Human
- Hands in frame add warmth and scale. A friend sprinkling herbs, lifting that cheese pull, or clinking a glass tells the viewer, “You’re invited.”
- Keep gestures purposeful and minimal—one action per shot so the parmi isn’t upstaged.

## Phone-First Editing (Fast and Honest)
- White balance: In Snapseed or Lightroom Mobile, use the plate as a neutral to correct orange heat-lamp tints.
- Exposure and contrast: Lift shadows slightly to reveal crumb; keep highlights in check so cheese stays detailed, not blown out.
- Color control: Nudge reds toward a touch less saturation; boost yellows’ luminance very slightly to make the cheese look melty without going neon.
- Texture/clarity: A small boost to texture on the crumb area only (use selective edits) keeps faces and background smooth.
- Crop for intent: Square for social feeds, 4:5 for maximum screen real estate, or a cinematic 16:9 for that wide pub-table story.

## Common Pitfalls and Quick Fixes
- Heat-lamp orange cast: Move the plate 30 cm away from the lamp, shoot toward window light, and fix white balance in post.
- Flat, lifeless crumb: Change the light direction—side light reveals texture. A tiny tilt of the plate can change everything.
- Glare on cheese: Diffuse with a napkin, or angle the camera so reflections bounce away from the lens.
- Messy plate edges: Quick wipe with a corner of serviette before shooting—small cleanup, big upgrade.
- Shaky hands in low light: Brace elbows on the table, use burst mode, and pick the sharpest frame.

## Respect the Dish (and Your Mates)
- Shoot fast so the parmi stays hot. Plan your frame while it’s being served, take a handful of decisive shots, then dive in.
- Don’t block the table, don’t rearrange beyond what you can put back—and always give the chips their stage time, too.

## Conclusion
Photographing a chicken parmigiana is about honoring its textures and telling a quick, delicious story with light, angle, and intent. You don’t need fancy gear—just a window, a steady hand, and a plan for that star moment when cheese stretches and crumb sparkles.
