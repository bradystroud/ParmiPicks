* Folded piece of ham was unusual
* Really tasty though
* Chicken tasted good, not reconstructed'
* Sweet potato chips were great
* Broccolini and zucchini where good, they were steamed but fried is better
* Cheese was nice.
* Chicken was crumbed well
* Mushrooms sauce was absolutely bussin'
* Discovered some carrots under the broccolini which was pretty awesome
