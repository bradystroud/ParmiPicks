Parmi with a purpose. Chef definitely came to play today.

\
As usual, not a big fan of the slice of ham. \
Mushroom gravy was great - quantity and quality.

When chefs put chips under the parmi it creates an uneven surface leading to cutting difficulties. This parmi however, knew its place on the place.

\
Not sure how it was cooked but the bottom of the crumbed chicken was soggy. The schnitzel should be crispy all around.
