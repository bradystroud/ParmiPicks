Great views, great parmi, great score.

This is the second parmi I've had at the Ramsgate, and it's clear they've read my previous review and cleaned up their act.
From the top:
The cheese - perfectly grilled, golden brown

Ham - diced, every restaurant should do diced, its so much better

Sauce - Barbecue sauce, normally not a fan but it kinda worked today. Dont know whyâ€¦ Food for thought

Chicken - definitely not Reconstituted chicken, this was a real breast

Chippies - classic pub straight cut fries, nicely salted

Salad - Simple, classy but nothing to write home about

If you're in SA this is one worth stopping for, located at Henley Beach
