A golden crumb glinting under warm light, ham just peeking through, scarlet sauce tugging at melted cheese—chicken parmigiana practically begs for a photo. But the camera doesn’t always capture the steam, the crunch, or that oozy, edge-of-plate drama. Here’s how to do your parmi justice with the phone that’s already in your pocket, no studio lights or fancy lenses required.

## Why Your Parmi Deserves Its Close-Up
Parmi is a texture-first dish: crisp meets creamy meets stringy. Good photos tell that texture story. Instead of aiming for a perfect “menu poster,” think: what’s the bite I’m desperate to take? Photograph that moment.

## Light: The Melt’s Best Friend
- Chase window light. Sit the plate near a window, with light coming from the side or slightly behind. That back/side light catches cheese sheen and crumb without washing out the sauce.
- Avoid overhead spotlights. Pub downlights can throw harsh glare. If you’re stuck with them, move the plate a few centimetres to dodge the hotspot.
- Diffuse if you can. A white napkin or menu propped between light and plate softens shadows and flattens glare.

## Angles That Flatter the Parmi
- 45-degree tilt: The all-rounder. Shows layers—crumb, ham, sauce, cheese—like a portrait.
- Close-up cross-section: Ask for (or make) a small cut at the edge. Shoot in tight so viewers can “hear” the crunch.
- Slight overhead (not flat-lay): 10–20 degrees above. Great for symmetrical plating and chips on the flank without losing height.

## Composition: Tell a Bite-Sized Story
- Rule of thirds for the hero bite. Place the sauciest, cheesiest section on a grid intersection.
- Negative space is your friend. Leave a quiet corner of the plate/table to let the parmi shine.
- Lead-in lines. Fork handles, chip edges, or the rim of the plate can guide eyes straight to the good stuff.

## Make Viewers Feel the Crunch
- Focus on the fringe. The outer edge of the parmi has the most texture. Tap-to-focus there.
- Side light + micro shadows. The tiny shadows in the crumb telegraph crispness—don’t blast them away with flash.
- Sprinkle restraint. A whisper of chopped parsley or cracked pepper creates contrast that exaggerates texture without “decorating” the dish into something it isn’t.

## Action Shots Without the Chaos
- The cheese pull: Use burst mode. One person lifts a slice slowly, the other fires away. Backlight makes the strands glow.
- The sauce swipe: Drag your fork gently through a saucy patch to show thickness. Capture mid-swipe.
- The clean cut: Wipe the knife, then slice. A tidy cut reads as intentional, not messy.

## Taming Shine, Steam, and Glare
- Shine control: If cheese glare is wild, nudge your angle a few degrees left or right to bounce light away from the lens.
- Steam drama: Backlight + quick timing while the plate is fresh. Cooler room air helps make steam visible.
- Mattify the scene: A cloth napkin, timber table, or matte tray contrasts with glossy cheese for a balanced look.

## Colour That Stays True to the Plate
- Lock your white balance if your phone allows it. Warm pub lighting can turn sauce orange or cheese neon.
- Step away from colored walls. Green or blue surroundings can leak tints into your photo—neutral backgrounds keep reds and golds honest.
- Edit lightly. Nudge exposure, bump contrast a touch, and increase clarity on the crumb. Skip heavy filters that distort food tones.

## Phone Settings That Actually Help
- Tap-to-focus on the edge of the parmi, then slide exposure down slightly to keep details in check.
- Use the grid. Keep the plate edge parallel to the frame or intentionally diagonal—no accidental tilts.
- Portrait mode sparingly. It can blur chips or salad into mush. If you use it, keep the depth effect mild.

## Backgrounds That Feel Like Real Life
- Pub table textures: weathered wood and paper coasters add character without stealing the show.
- Keep props purposeful. A fork, a napkin, maybe the drink you’re actually having. If it’s not telling the parmi story, it can go.
- Watch the edges. Stray phones, keys, and sauce sachets creeping into corners yank eyes from the hero.

## Quick Fixes for Common Photo Fails
- Overexposed cheese: Lower exposure until you can see detail in the melt.
- Dull crumb: Side light and a tighter crop on the edge bring the crunch back to life.
- Busy plate: Slide chips or salad slightly to create breathing room.
- Grease lens blur: Wipe the lens. Parmis are splashy business.

## Plating Without Pretence
You’re not redecorating dinner—just staging it. Align the parmi so the best edge faces the light. If a piece of ham is hiding, coax it into view. Rotate, don’t rebuild.

## Editing: Finish Like a Pro, Fast
- Crop for the story. If the cheese pull is the hero, let it fill the frame.
- Contrast and structure, not saturation. You want crispness, not cartoon reds.
- Keep a consistent look. If you share often, small, repeatable tweaks make your feed feel intentional.

## Conclusion
Great parmi photos aren’t about gadgets—they’re about noticing what makes the dish irresistible and showing that moment clearly. Light the melt, frame the crunch, and keep it true to the plate in front of you. If it makes you want to grab a fork, it’s a win.
